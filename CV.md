## Curriculum Vitae


>> ### **PhD in Oceanography**
---
> **3 Fluent languagues -- scientific english**

> **Excelent laboratory, field, and writing skills**

> **Deep experience managing model outputs and observational data**


### **Research Interests**

During my thesis, my research line focused on the organic carbon dynamics in the ocean at regional scales, with special interest in their relevance in the global ocean carbon cycle. My main goal was to contribute to the understanding of the organic carbon exchange between coastal upwelling regions and the adjacent oligotrophic open ocean. My primary research tools were the interpretation and analysis of observational data, both collected *in situ* and remotely sensed, coupled with the use of physical-biogeochemical models.
At present, my research line also includes the assimilation of real data, from ocean color and *in situ* profiles, into a 1/4 of degree resolution configuration of the NEMO-PISCES simulation for the North Atlantic. My main goal is to contribute to improve the accuracy of the biogeochemical component of the Copernicus ocean forecast system.
