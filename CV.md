## Research Interests

My research line focuses on the organic carbon dynamics in the ocean at regional scales, with special interest in their relevance in the global ocean carbon cycle. My main goal is to contribute to the understanding of the organic carbon exchange between coastal upwelling regions and the adjacent oligotrophic open ocean. My primary research tools are the interpretation and analysis of observational data, both in situ and remotely sensed, coupled with the use of physical biogeochemical regional models.
