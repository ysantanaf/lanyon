![I hope you'll find this site of your interest](https://github.com/ysantanaf/ysantanaf.github.io/blob/master/diver.jpg?raw=true)

I am PhD in Oceanography working as a Post-Doc at the CNRM, a data-driven computational oceanography group based at MétéoFrance, Toulouse. My research line focuses on;

  - Ocean Extremes
  - Biogeochemical Modelling
  - CMIP6 Models
  - Ocean Data Assimilation
  - Mesoscale features

### I currrently work on how ocean extremes (high temperature, low oxygen, etc) may influence ocean biogeochemistry

I am also a traveling-lover, and enjoy spending time doing some [photography] and [writings].
