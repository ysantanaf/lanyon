# Things about me

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

I am PhD in Oceanography workins as a Research Engineer at the MEOM team (http://meom-group.github.io/), a data-driven computational oceanography group based at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, France. My research line focuses on;

  - Organic carbon dynamics
  - Mesoscales features
  - Modelling tools
  - Ocean Data Assimilation

### I work on how biogeochemical fluxes are influenced by the ocean dynamics

I am also a traveling-lover, and enjoy spending time doing some [photography] and [writings].
