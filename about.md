![I hope you'll find this site of your interest](https://github.com/ysantanaf/ysantanaf.github.io/blob/master/diver.jpg?raw=true)

I am PhD in Oceanography working as Research Engineer (Post-Doc) at the MEOM team ([meom]), a data-driven computational oceanography group based at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, France. My research line focuses on;

  - Organic carbon dynamics
  - Ocean Data Assimilation
  - Biogeochemical Modelling
  - Mesoscale features

### I work on how biogeochemical fluxes are influenced by the ocean dynamics

I am also a traveling-lover, and enjoy spending time doing some [photography] and [writings].
